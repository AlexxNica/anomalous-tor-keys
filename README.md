[ ] Try to compute some of the private keys. Need to include how we did this in the paper along with the number of private keys we were able to compute. (Yorgos)
[x] Look at consensus files to see exactly how long relays were available (Lali)
[x] Run experiment using all publicly available RSA keys (129 million) (Lali to investigate email 2016 Nadia)
[x] Add bridging relay server descriptors (Philipp)
[ ] Look at Trawling code and see what happened work with Trawling (Yorgos)
[ ] Work with Luxembourg team on why they were generating keys with shared prime factors.  (Claudia)
[ ] Write paper (ALL/Yorgos: Implications to Tor)
[x] Re-run experiment (Philipp) (Josh did this for us)
[x] Tar ball for code to make it easy to share with outside developers (add code to github)  (Claudia)
[ ] 2,217 of these 2,236 (ALL)
[ ] 10 of these 2,236 (ALL)
[ ] 7 of these 2,236 (ALL)
[ ] 2 of these 2,236 (ALL)
[ ] Ethical considerations: Trawling experiment  (Lali, Philipp)
[ ] Get info about dataset. Table of break down of the 3.7 keys, onion vs. signing, archived vs. recent, how many relays they were all together. Count relays by different fingerprints/identity keys. Count relays by distinct IP addresses. One machine can rotate signing keys.  (Claudia)
[ ] For weak keys get info of how many different IP addresses and fingerprints (Claudia)
[ ] Mention in paper that graphs on log-log scale (Claudia)
[ ] Analysis of the 10 keys with repeated moduli (Yorgos, Philipp)
[ ] Implications of keys with repeated moduli (Laura)
[x] Check if all moduli are 1024 length (Phillip)
[ ] Group weak keys into families. A family is a group of weak keys that share a common prime. Include analysis about weak key families in the paper.
