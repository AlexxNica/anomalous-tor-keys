\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

I plan to continue investigating this research problem along with my advisers. I have reached out to the authors of~\cite{biryukov2013trawling} to ask if they were aware that they were generating RSA public keys with shared prime factors, and if so, what was their reasoning behind this. I also asked them if they hosted the Tor relays on any other machines besides Amazon EC2. One of the authors has replied and has agreed to look into the issue. Given that I detected over 3,000 factorable keys, the next step is to attempt to compute some of the private keys. Finally,~\cite{heninger2012mining} cite that the fastgcd algorithm is able to factor more keys if you serve it a larger collection of inputs since it will have a larger factor base to use on each key.~\cite{hastings2016weak} successfully extracted 81 million distinct RSA keys. I will re-run fastgcd using all Tor signing and onion keys in conjunction with these 81 million distinct RSA keys to detect whether there are more vulnerable Tor keys than I originally found in this paper.
