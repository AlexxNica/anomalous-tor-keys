\section{Introduction}
Tor is an anonymity network.  It utilizes various cryptosystems, 
one of which is the RSA cryptosystem.  Previous research has 
shown that weak RSA public keys exist in the wild, which puts users at 
risk for decryption attacks.  

Tor relays operators are expected to generate RSA keys properly . . ., but 
we found that there were thousands of keys that didn't conform to the Tor 
Specification and that were weak.

We find RSA public keys that share prime factors.

We find RSA public keys that share the same modulus.  (Had others explored this?)

We find RSA public keys that have non-standard exponents.  (Had others explored this?)

Did we find repeated RSA public keys?

Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We find weak keys in Tor (previously unexplored)
  \item We manually investigate the source of the weak keys 
    through contacting researchers
  \item We call attention to how researchers' experiments can put Tor users
    information at risk
\end{itemize}
